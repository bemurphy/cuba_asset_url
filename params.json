This allows you to cache your\r\ncss/js assets and prevents browsers from getting stuck with old assets on\r\nnew deploys.\r\n\r\nThe plugin makes an assumption that, your app has a file in root named\r\n`assets.json` that looks somthing like this:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"all.css\": \"/compiled/all-8c18cbb09b70c847500da8818bac816f.css\",\r\n  \"all.js\": \"/compiled/all-d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e.js\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou may of course organize your assets among multiple files however you wish,\r\nbut the layout should reference assets from this manifest file.\r\n\r\nYou can generate the signature files with a process like that found in the\r\ngist at https://gist.github.com/bemurphy/23ed00cc4f28676e28ca\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n    gem 'cuba_asset_url'\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle\r\n\r\nOr install it yourself as:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install cuba_asset_url\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nIn production/staging, enable via `ENV['USE_ASSET_SIGNATURES'] = true`\r\n\r\nIn your template, use the `css_url` and `js_url` for the path to the asset:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<link href=\"<%= css_url(:all) %>\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\r\n\r\n<script src=\"<%= js_url(:all) %>\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe argument is the name of the attribute key in the manifest file.  `:all` is\r\na nice convention but you can change this if you wish.\r\n\r\nIf you aren't set to use asset_signatures, the config will be rebuilt to default\r\nto the same path but with the signature bit stripped out.  So\r\n\r\n```\r\n/compiled/foo-af134d.css\r\n```\r\n\r\nbecomes\r\n```\r\n/compiled/foo.css\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1.
