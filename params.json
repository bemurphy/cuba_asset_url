This allows you to cache your\r\ncss/js assets and prevents browsers from getting stuck with old assets on\r\nnew deploys.\r\n\r\nThe plugin makes a few simple assumptions:\r\n\r\n1. You serve a single css file from `/css/app.css`\r\n2. You serve a single js file from `/js/app.js`\r\n3. You have a file in root named `assets.json` that looks somthing like this:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"app.css\": \"/css/app-8c18cbb09b70c847500da8818bac816f.css\",\r\n  \"app.js\": \"/js/app-d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e.js\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou may of course organize your assets among multiple files however you wish,\r\nbut the layout should only reference the two assets.\r\n\r\nYou can generate the signature files with a process like that found in the\r\ngist at https://gist.github.com/bemurphy/23ed00cc4f28676e28ca\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n    gem 'cuba_asset_url'\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle\r\n\r\nOr install it yourself as:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install cuba_asset_url\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nIn production/staging, enable via `ENV['USE_ASSET_SIGNATURES'] = true`\r\n\r\nIn your template, use the `css_url` and `js_url` for the path to the asset:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<link href=\"<%= css_url %>\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\r\n\r\n<script src=\"<%= js_url %>\"></script>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Todo\r\n\r\nProbably it would be better to not assume the assets but rather pass a path\r\nto the helper.  This would enable people who prefer a `public/script` or\r\n`public/styles` directory.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1. Fork it ( http://github.com/<my-github-username>/cuba_asset_url/fork )\r\n2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\r\n3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)\r\n4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)\r\n5.
